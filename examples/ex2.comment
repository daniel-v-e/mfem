 Description:  This example code solves a simple linear elasticity problem
               describing a multi-material cantilever beam.

               Specifically, we approximate the weak form of -div(sigma(u))=0
               where sigma(u)=lambda*div(u)*I+mu*(grad*u+u*grad) is the stress
               tensor corresponding to displacement field u, and lambda and mu
               are the material Lame constants. The boundary conditions are
               u=0 on the fixed part of the boundary with attribute 1, and
               sigma(u).n=f on the remainder with f being a constant pull down
               vector on boundary elements with attribute 2, and zero
               otherwise. The geometry of the domain is assumed to be as
               follows:

                                 +----------+----------+
                    boundary --->| material | material |<--- boundary
                    attribute 1  |    1     |    2     |     attribute 2
                    (fixed)      +----------+----------+     (pull down)

               The example demonstrates the use of high-order and NURBS vector
               finite element spaces with the linear elasticity bilinear form,
               meshes with curved elements, and the definition of piece-wise
               constant and vector coefficient objects. Static condensation is
               also illustrated.

               We recommend viewing Example 1 before viewing this example.
